# ProjectFlow

ProjectFlow is a lightweight project and task tracker for software teams.
Organizations own projects, projects own tasks, and tasks carry a status, a
priority and a discussion thread.

It is a TypeScript monorepo: a NestJS + MongoDB API and a Next.js App Router
frontend, sharing a small package of domain types and enums.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20.19+** (22 or 24 recommended)
- **pnpm 10+** — `npm install -g pnpm`
- **MongoDB 7+** running locally

On macOS:

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@7.0
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
```

Any reachable MongoDB works — point `MONGODB_URI` wherever you like.

---

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Environment setup

Configuration lives in a single `.env` file at the repository root; both apps
read it.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable              | Purpose                          | Default                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `MONGODB_URI`         | MongoDB connection string        | `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/projectflow` |
| `JWT_SECRET`          | Signing secret for access tokens | — (required)                            |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`      | Access token lifetime            | `7d`                                    |
| `API_PORT`            | Port the API listens on          | `4732`                                  |
| `WEB_ORIGIN`          | Origin allowed by CORS           | `http://localhost:3742`                 |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | API base URL used by the browser | `http://localhost:4732`                 |

The API refuses to boot if `MONGODB_URI` or `JWT_SECRET` is missing.

## Database

Make sure MongoDB is running, then load development data:

```bash
pnpm seed
```

The seed is repeatable — it clears the ProjectFlow collections and reinserts a
fresh organization, users, projects, tasks and comments.

## Running the apps

```bash
pnpm dev
```

- Web — <http://localhost:3742>
- API — <http://localhost:4732>

Both apps deliberately avoid the usual 3000/4000 defaults so they do not clash
with other projects. To move the web app, set `WEB_PORT` in your shell and
update `WEB_ORIGIN` in `.env` to match, so CORS keeps working:

```bash
WEB_PORT=3800 pnpm --filter @projectflow/web dev
```

The API port comes from `API_PORT` in `.env`; change `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to
match if you move it.

Run one at a time if you prefer:

```bash
pnpm --filter @projectflow/api dev
pnpm --filter @projectflow/web dev
```

## From a clean checkout

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm seed
pnpm dev
```

## Commands

| Command          | Description                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm dev`       | Run the API and web app in watch mode      |
| `pnpm build`     | Build every package and app                |
| `pnpm lint`      | ESLint across the workspace                |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TypeScript project-wide, no emit           |
| `pnpm test`      | API test suite (uses an in-memory MongoDB) |
| `pnpm seed`      | Reset and reload development data          |
| `pnpm format`    | Prettier write                             |

`pnpm test` does not need a running MongoDB — it starts a throwaway in-memory
server for the duration of the run. The first run downloads a MongoDB binary
(around 100 MB) and caches it.

## Development credentials

Seeded accounts, all sharing the password `Password123!`:

| Name         | Email                 | Access                    |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Ammar Yaser  | `ammar@example.com`   | Organization owner        |
| Sarah Ahmed  | `sarah@example.com`   | Organization admin        |
| Ahmed Hassan | `ahmed@example.com`   | Project manager on `ENG`  |
| Magd Ali     | `magd@example.com`    | Member of `ENG` and `WEB` |
| Outside User | `outside@example.com` | No organization           |

These are local development accounts only.

### API layering

Each module follows the same shape: controller → service → Mongoose model, with
DTOs validating input at the boundary. Controllers stay thin; business rules
live in services.

### Domain model

```
User
Organization        ── OrganizationMember ── User      (OWNER | ADMIN | MEMBER)
Organization  ── Project
Project             ── ProjectMember      ── User      (PROJECT_MANAGER | MEMBER)
Project       ── Task ── Comment
```

Membership is stored in its own collection rather than as arrays on the parent
document, so it can be indexed and queried directly. Both membership
collections carry a unique compound index on their two foreign keys.

Tasks are numbered per project and identified by a human-readable key derived
from the project key: `ENG-1`, `ENG-2`, `WEB-1`.

### Authorization

`ProjectAccessService` answers "may this user touch this project?" in one
place. Access comes from either an elevated organization role (`OWNER` or
`ADMIN`, which grants access to every project in the organization) or an
explicit project membership row. `assertCanView` gates reads, `assertCanManage`
gates configuration and membership changes.

Authentication is a JWT bearer token. `JwtAuthGuard` is registered globally;
routes opt out with the `@Public()` decorator.

### API surface

```
POST   /auth/register
POST   /auth/login
GET    /auth/me

GET    /organizations

GET    /projects
POST   /projects
GET    /projects/:projectId
GET    /projects/:projectId/members
POST   /projects/:projectId/members

GET    /projects/:projectId/tasks
POST   /projects/:projectId/tasks
GET    /tasks/:taskId
PATCH  /tasks/:taskId
PATCH  /tasks/:taskId/status
DELETE /tasks/:taskId

GET    /tasks/:taskId/comments
POST   /tasks/:taskId/comments
```

Errors share one shape:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "You do not have access to this project",
  "error": "Forbidden"
}
```

### Frontend

Routes are thin; the work happens in `features/`. Server state is owned by
TanStack Query — query keys live in `lib/query-keys.ts` so invalidation stays
predictable — and local UI state stays in React. The API client in
`lib/api-client.ts` centralises the base URL, the auth header and error
parsing.

Components are server components by default; `"use client"` is added only where
interactivity or hooks require it.

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Task Numbering Concurrency Fix
**Decision**: Replaced `countDocuments` with an atomic `$inc` operator on the `Project` schema.
**Reasoning**: Ensures that concurrent task creations never result in identical task identifiers. Relying on `countDocuments` introduces a race condition because multiple processes can read the same count before any of them write the new document.

### 2. Activity History Architecture
**Decision**: Implemented `TaskActivity` as a separate Mongoose collection instead of embedding it into the `Task` document.
**Reasoning**: Activity logs grow infinitely and could hit MongoDB's 16MB document limit if embedded inside a single task. A dedicated collection is much easier to scale, paginate, index, and archive. 

### 3. Frontend Server State Management
**Decision**: Utilized optimistic updates in TanStack Query for the task assignment feature.
**Reasoning**: Assigning a user to a task should feel instantaneous. By mutating the query cache immediately (`onMutate`) and rolling back on failure (`onError`), the UI remains highly responsive regardless of network latency.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Pagination of Activity Logs**: Currently uses basic offset pagination (`skip`/`limit`). While adequate for standard usage, this strategy can experience performance degradation as the offset grows significantly. Cursor-based pagination should be implemented if activity logs scale massively.
- **Data Caching**: The API heavily relies on direct database queries. There is no Redis layer or robust application-level caching, meaning read-heavy operations (e.g., loading a massive Kanban board) could bottleneck under high concurrent load.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Authentication currently relies solely on access tokens with a 7-day expiration. There is no refresh token mechanism, which is a significant security weakness for production apps because access tokens cannot easily be revoked.
- **Rate Limiting**: No rate-limiting middleware (like `@nestjs/throttler`) is in place. Endpoints, particularly `/auth/login`, remain vulnerable to brute-force and DoS attacks.
